This project contains the sample code which we used for Mobile Automation POC .Brief technolgy explanation is below 

Geb/Spock - Automation testng framework 
Appium - Mobile Automation but used as Proxy Server
Gradle - Build Tool

We intended to create this POC project just to demonstrate that automation tests can be re-used and same tests can be used for 
mobile web as well to avoid separate tests creation
